# Van Renting Website


Welcome to the Van Renting Website repository! 
This project is designed to provide a experience for users looking to rent vans and hosts to manage them.
The repository is organized into two main components: the backend and the frontend.

It facilitates the management and interaction with a fleet of vans. 
Users can sign up, sign in, view van details, rent vans (for consumers), release vans (for hosts), and perform various other operations based on their roles.

## Backend

The backend of the Van Renting Website is responsible for handling data storage, user authentication, and managing the interactions with the database.
